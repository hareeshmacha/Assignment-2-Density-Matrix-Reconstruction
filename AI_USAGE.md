# AI Attribution & Usage Policy

## Disclosure
This project was developed primarily by the author. **Gemini** was used minimally for initial project setup and debugging assistance.

## Prompt Log
The following is a summary of the limited interactions used during development:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Planning | Consulted for project structure best practices. |
| Setup | Generation of initial directory hierarchy. |
| Debugging | Assistance with resolving specific Python syntax errors. |

## Verification
All code, including the minimal AI-suggested components, was rigorously verified through:
1.  **Manual Code Review**: All mathematical logic (e.g., Cholesky decomposition) was implemented and reviewed by the author.
2.  **Unit Testing**: Functions were tested to ensure physical constraints (trace = 1, PSD).
3.  **Experimental Validation**: Model performance metrics were strictly evaluated.
